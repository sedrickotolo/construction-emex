    The total cost of conventional inspections are far greater than the expense of cleaning and MFE inspection. The cost of material transfer, product downgrades and tank downtime are enormous. </p><p>
    The hidden cost of premature repairs can be just as high. When the tank is empty, you will ll have to complete all repairs quickly. This usually means paying a premium for service and completing repairs that are not necessary for another five to 10 years. Now you can reduce costs by completing an API 653 inspection of your AST (Above- Ground Storage Tank) without taking the tank down for manual cleaning and inspection</p><p>RTI can scan the floor of a full tank while in- service and provide you with a quantitative assessment of tank floor integrity all with greater reliability and</p><p><ul><li>Eliminate the high cost of taking down your tanks</li><li>

    <p><b>The RTI service follows a digital inspection grid and collects more than 200,000 UT scans* for computer analysis.</b></p><p>The RTI service systematically scans the tank bottom with an array of eight ultrasonic transducers, and relays high- volume UT data for analysis.

    High-density UT scanning reveals more about the true condition of your tank. The full Service tank inspection provides a complete, 10-year API 653 report on the condition of your tank. </p><p>

Tanks were first tested robotically while in operation, and then drained, cleaned and inspected conventionally. These results consistently confirmed that the RTI evaluation yielded an estimate of remaining useful floor life that was identical to an out- of-service inspection. </p>

Between the scanner bridge magnetic poles, a near-saturation magnetic flux is induced in the material examined. The scanner sensor detects flux leakage changes when the plate thickness changes. This may indicate the presence of discontinuities, such as pitting and corrosion, on the process and/or soil side. The scanner is moved over the entire tank bottom surface to provide the required inspection coverage. Technicians interpret the scanner display to identify damaged areas and in some cases, estimate the amount of metal loss.

The specimen is magnetised either locally or overall, and if the material is sound the magnetic flux is predominantly inside the material. If, however, there is a surface-breaking flaw, the magnetic field is distorted, causing local magnetic flux leakage around the flaw. This leakage flux is displayed by covering the surface with very fine iron particles applied either dry or suspended in a liquid. The particles accumulate at the regions of flux leakage, producing a build-up which can be seen visually even when the crack opening is very narrow. Thus, a crack is indicated as a line of iron powder particles on the surface.<div class="mt-5"><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#exampleModal">Get Details</button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header border-white" id=""><button class="accordion-button border-white collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne">NDT Inspection Video Borescope Inspection</button></h2><div id="collapseOne" class="container accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample"><div class="accordion-body row"><div class="accordion-img col-md-3"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/boroscope.jpg"></div><div class="accordion-text col-md-9 p-4 align-middle position-relative">A borescope (occasionally called a boroscope, though this spelling is nonstandard) is an optical instrument designed to assist visual inspection of narrow, difficult-to-reach cavities, consisting of a rigid or flexible tube with an eyepiece or display on one end, an objective lens or camera on the other end.<div class="mt-5"><button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#exampleModal">Get Details</button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header border-white" id=""><button class="accordion-button border-white collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseEleven" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseEleven">OCTG Inspection</button></h2><div id="collapseEleven" class="container accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample"><div class="accordion-body row"><div class="accordion-img col-md-3"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/octg.jpg"></div><div class="accordion-text col-md-9 p-4 align-middle position-relative"><p>Drilling is an integral part of the Oil exploration activities and as such cannot be overemphasized.

This means that measurements can be performed on objects covered with insulation, asbestos, fireproofing, concrete or coating. The high costs for removal of insulation can therefore be avoided. Scaffolding can be reduced by using rope access or by mounting the measuring sensor on an extension pole.</p><p><b>Principle</b></p>
    <p>An eddy current sensor is placed on top of the thermal insulation. By means of a low frequency (pulsed) magnetic field, eddy currents are generated in the material. By measuring the duration of the eddy currents, a thickness calculation is made. This thickness calculation gives the average thickness of the material, within the enclosed magnetic field (footprint). The diameter of the footprint varies between 25 and 150mm dependent on wall thickness and thickness of the insulation.</p>
